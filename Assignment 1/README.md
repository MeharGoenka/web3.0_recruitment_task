I have written the code using python.
The program starts with beginning the timer and then taking the string input.

Then starting from 1, it checks the hash value for each number added to the end of the string. 
If it is lesser than th target value, the while loop breaks as it has found the nouce value.

Then the timer ends and the total time taken for the nounce value to be found is calculated.
